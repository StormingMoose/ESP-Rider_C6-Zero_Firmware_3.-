# ESP-Rider_C6-Zero_Firmware_3.-

Trying to improve my coding so this program uses many .ino files in the same directory and it is working.

Need to boot the esp32, connect phone to the access point, load the webpage at 192.168.4.1. 

Used the network server instead of webserver to get it to work with firmware 3.
