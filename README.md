# ESP-Rider_C6-Zero_Firmware_3.-

W.I.P.

Trying to improve my coding so this program uses many .ino files in the same directory and it is working except as noted below.

not working correctly - wifi  odd error, need to boot the esp32 connect phone to the access point, load the webpage at 192.168.4.1 and then the buttons do not work until you reboot the esp32 c6 zero and do not reload the webpage.  just reconnect to the access point, go to the previously opened webpage and for me it was working, go figure.

working - servo

working - motor

not working - light on the board control
